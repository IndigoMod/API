- Move to a more reliable host than ReplIT. (Pebblehost, **Bluehost**, etc?)
- Port to Express (Should be easy!)
- Move to Python and Flask due to its reliability and speed (Probably not going to be easy, I prefer NodeJS)
- Grab custom domain (Reccomending api.indigo.ucyt.dev). Can you confirm that's a valid subdomain UCYT? Too poor to buy my own :)
- Restrict some files.
