# TODO
- [ ] Connect with the IndigoMod loader (such as implementing a method that checks if IndigoMod is running on any device).
- [ ] Make an API method that allows for reading and parsing of packets.
- [ ] Port to Express from HTTP (currently too lazy to do this, will do soon hopefully. HTTP is substantially enough to run an API as of now).
- [x] Make dynamic JSON response builder (May cause errors, can change back).
- [x] Make documentation request method.
