This is the API meant for the project made by UCYT5040 and I called "IndigoMod".
The Indigo API is meant for collecting statistics from IndigoMod's modloader.
IndigoMod is a modloader made for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

View the project at [IndigoMod's website](https://indigomod.github.io/)

If you came here from my NodeJS api tutorial, thank you!
I hope you'll come and see my other tutorials as well.
